        Even when I'm home, it feels like the middle of nowhere. I need to keep moving.

        Newly graduated Computer Engineering student, interested in making stuff and how it works. I need to start my
        career soon or I’ll starve to death.
        I'm totally okay with any field — Networking, Software Development, Embedded Systems, or Hardware.
        Hybrid or remote would be great for savings.

        Personally, I'm currently interested in motorsport, mostly rally. And trying to get good at sim-racing — not
        easy!
        Maybe a job in motorsport? Keep dreaming.
